## PyTimer

**AIM** The aim of the "PyTimer" project is to provide a simple tool for measure and analyze the execution time of code.

It achieves this by implementing a decorator that wraps a given function and measures the time it takes to execute the function using the time module. This execution time is then printed for analysis.
