## PyTimer

**AIM** The aim of the "PyTimer" project is to provide a simple tool for measure and analyze the execution time of code.

It achieves this by implementing a decorator that wraps a given function and measures the time it takes to execute the function using the time module. This execution time is then printed for analysis.


## GuessMaster

GuessMaster is an interactive Python game that challenges players to guess a secret number within a specified range. The game is designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts while providing an engaging user experience.
